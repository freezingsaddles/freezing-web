title: Food Rescue Rides
description: |
  BikeArlington and Food Rescue DC are partnering on a pointless prize
  to encourage Freezing Saddlers to get some miles while doing some
  good. Food Rescue is a nonprofit coordinates volunteers who pick-up
  excess healthy food from local food donors and deliver it directly
  to local social service agencies that feed the food insecure.

  Make food rescue rides, tag them with <code>#foodrescue</code>. If
  you make multiple rescues on one ride, append the number of rescues
  to the tag with an <code>x</code> like so:
  <code>#foodrescue<strong>x2</strong></code>.
