title: Pointless Kids
description: |
  When you ride with your kids (that is, they are riding with you on their own bikes), tag your ride <code>#withkid<em>[kid codename]</em></code> and they'll show up here. If you ride with multiple kids at once, multiple hashtags are supported.
  <p>
  Keep it consistent and make your name unique. For example, jrenaut's kids picked new names for themselves one year - pepper8cheez and socr4evr11, so when he rode with one or both of them, he added <code>#withkidpepper8cheez</code> or <code>#withkidsocr4evr11</code>, as appropriate. Keep in mind if you ride with another BAFS participant AND your kid, make sure only one of you tags the kid, or else the miles will be double counted.
  <p>
  For the purpose of this contest, a kid is defined as a human being younger than 14 years old. Older than that and they can have their own Strava account.
