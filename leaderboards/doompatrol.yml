title: Doom Patrol
description: |
  Your task is to ride <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/8098826" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">up and down 15th
  Street between the Jefferson Memorial &amp; Constitution Ave</a>.
  If you see trucks or construction equipment, pull up and call Elizabeth (see the sign-up form) so WABA can
  start their legal response.
  <p>
  Hopefully it's just a quiet, pleasant bike ride. Ride safe, follow traffic laws,
  and don't do anything you're not comfortable with.
  <p>
  Patrol runs from 2/19 through either the end of BAFS or the start of lane removal work, whichever comes first.
