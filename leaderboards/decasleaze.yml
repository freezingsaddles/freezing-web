description: |
  A <strong>Decasleaze</strong> is a day consisting of one or more rides that are, collectively at least 10 miles,
  but less than 11 miles. These rides yield between 65-66 points, the optimal point on our scoring graph for maximizing
  your points without having to bike a huge amount.
