	<p>When you ride with your kids (that is, they are riding with you on their own bikes), tag your ride #withkid[kid codename] and they'll show up here. If you ride with multiple kids at once, multiple hashtags are supported.</p>
	<p>Keep it consistent and make your name unique. For example, jrenaut's kids picked new names for themselves this year - pepper8cheez and socr4evr11, so when he rides with one or both of them, he adds #withkidpepper8cheez or #withkidsocr4evr11, as appropriate. Keep in mind if you ride with another BAFS parcipant AND your kid, make sure only one of you tags the kid, or else the miles will be double counted.</p>

	<p>For the purpose of this contest, a kid is defined as a human being younger than 14 years old. Older than that and they can have their own Strava account.</p>
