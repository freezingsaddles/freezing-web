            Make sure you have registered on the <a href="{{ registration_site }}">signup sheet</a>.

                So you are a Strava athlete, we get that. Unfortunately, one of these two things is true:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        you did not give Strava permission for us to "View your complete Strava profile".
                        Without that, we can't see what clubs you belong to.

                            you are not registered with any of the configured Freezing Saddles team clubs;
                            if that is the case, <strong>You need to join a competition team Strava club.</strong>
                            Or maybe the app just needs to be updated to know about the Strava teams.
                        </li>

                Don't worry, your rides will count but they won't be on any leaderboards until you have joined one of the

                <strong>Houston we have a problem</strong>.
                It looks like you joined _multiple_ Strava clubs that are registered as competition teams.
                Here are the problematic teams (please ensure you are only a member of one of them):
                <ul>
                    {% for team in multiple_teams %}
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/{{ team.id }}">{{ team.name }}</a>
                        </li>
                    {% endfor %}
                </ul>
            </li>
        {% else %}
            <li>
                <strong>You are registered with a team!</strong>
                You are a member of the
                <a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/{{ team.id }}"><strong>{{ team.name }}</strong></a> Strava club.
            </li>
            {% if not competition_teams_assigned %}
                <li>
                    <em>Later</em>, you will need to join a <strong>competition team Strava club</strong> as well; please attend the season opener Happy Hour (watch the <a href="{{ forum_site }}">forum for an announcement</a>) and check your email for updates. That will make you show up on the <a href="/leaderboard/team">team</a> <a href="/leaderboard/team_text">leaderboards</a>.
                </li>
            {% endif %}
            <li>
                See <a href="/people/">other folks who have registered for the event</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                View your <a href={{ rides_url }}>personal rides page</a>.
